Bill: Hi Ben, how are you?
Ben: Good.  This chat program is neat.
Bill: Yes, written in Java you know.
Ben: Java, what's that?
Bill: A really good computer programming language, better than Python.
Ben: Oh right. 
Bill: You know, I think we're being recorded.
Ben: We are?  Why?
Bill: Probably for some kind of homework assignment.
Ben: What's the assignment about?
Bill: Not sure, maybe Collections.
Ben: Collections?  You mean data structures?
Bill: Yes, they call them Collections in Java. They're generic you know.
Ben: Generic?  That's those funny angle brackets, isn't it?
Bill: That's them. Beats treating everything as plain objects.
Ben: OK. So, about the assignment.  What's involved?
Bill: I bet it's some kind of word count, so let's say funny things.
Ben: OK, blah bah blah blah blah blah!
Bill: This a goofy word cbsdsjhcjksbckbksdbjkbjsbdkjbsdskjbkjdbkbk
Ben: OK, I've had enough, the Sounders are on TV, bye.
